## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Google Calendar API credentials

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gcal-simplified.git
cd gcal-simplified
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API credentials:

```env
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
```

### Running the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the Electron app with hot module replacement (HMR) enabled.

## Testing 🧪

The project uses a comprehensive testing strategy combining Unit tests (Vitest) and End-to-End tests (Playwright).

### Running All Tests

To run the full test suite (Unit + E2E):

```bash
npm test
```

### Unit Tests (Vitest)

Unit tests focus on individual components and logic/utils. They are located in `src/**/__tests__`.

Run unit tests only:

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

E2E tests verify the full application capabilities in a real Electron environment. They are located in `e2e/`.

Run E2E tests only:

```bash
npm run test:run
```

For interactive debugging with the Playwright UI:

```bash
npm run test:ui
```

### Cleaning Test Results

To remove generated test results, screenshots, and reports:

```bash
npm run test:clean
```

## Building for Production 🏗️

Build the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will:

1. Compile TypeScript
2. Build the Vite bundle
3. Package the Electron application using electron-builder

The built application installers will be in the `release/<version>` directory (e.g., `release/0.0.0/`).
