description: Verify code needed and rebase to main

goal: rebase to main

start by checking the branch you are on.
If you are on a "main" branch expect to get the branch we want to rebase as an additional input, if not provided stop and ask for it.
(if you are already not on the main branch we will be rebasing this branch to main)

The branch was generated by AI some time ago and our goal is to validate and rebase.

1. Verify the code in this branch is needed (wasn't merged already by another PR or too old and not needed anymore)
2. if the code is NOT needed or can cause high risk failures stop and report back
3. rebase to main branch and resolve conflicts
4. review the code, perform fixs if needed
5. run relevant tests, if test are failing it's a high risk chagne, report back for user desition
